### Wordy Explanation
**1.** When a lobby is initiated**(start_game command used)**, every participant is required to **prove** their **activity**. This, as of the latest update, is recoginized as reacting to the lobby message with 🖌️. If any of the participants **fail** to prove activity within `30` seconds, the game will consequently fail to start. Players can also vote for take-down using the emoji TAKEDOWN.

**2.** After **every** participant have proven their activity, the game will begin after 5 seconds. Chat will be **disabled** until the first drawing is submitted.

**3.** A member is then chosen to submit a drawing of a random theme. You can draw the theme on literally anything, you candraw it on a piece of paper, take a picture and DM the bot, you can draw the picture on MS paint and send the bot, literally anything!. If they **fail** to submit the picture within a time frame of `60 seconds`, they will recieve a deduction and the game will continue onto another person in queue.

**4.** If however the member **successfully** submitted the drawing, the other participants will have a timeframe of `70 seconds` to guess.

**5.** All players who are able to answer correctly gets the points, the faster the more points.

**6.** This process is repeated through every member and every rounds.

### How can I run this project?
Create a virtualenv and install all dependencies inside `requirements.txt`.

> If you are unfamiliar with virtualenv, follow the steps below.

To run this project manually, follow these steps:

* 1. Install the discord.py module (USE PYTHON 3.8 OR ABOVE)

You can get the library directly from PyPI:
On macOS:
```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
If you are using Windows, then the following should be used instead:
```
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

* 2. Install the menus extension of the discord.py module
```
py -3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus
```
If you don't have git, make sure to install it before the menus extension.

* 3. Setup dotenv for token feeding

a. Install python-dotenv
macOS:
```
python3 -m pip install python-dotenv
```
Windows:
```
py -3 -m pip install python-dotenv
```
b. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
This must be in the same directory as `__main__.py`

d. Insert in your token
~~~
TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
~~~
